My version of an algorithmic cloth. Doing one of these from scratch is kind of a right of passage for anyone getting into programmatic physics. I wanted something that was light and elastic while being delicate enough to fray. Built with raw javascript using Verlet integration physics logic. Click and drag to move the fabric around. Pull hard to tear. Weirdly therapeutic.
